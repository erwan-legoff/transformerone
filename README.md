TransformerOne is my hands-on exploration of building and training a GPT-like language model from scratch. This allowed me to : 

- Understand and implement core NLP concepts (tokenization, attention mechanisms)
- Work with PyTorch to create deep learning architectures
- Develop training pipelines and evaluation metrics
- Improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning
